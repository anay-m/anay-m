## 👋🏾 Hey, I'm Anay!

I’m a software engineer intern at **Stripe** and an aspiring founder. I love building my own projects.

Follow along at my [anaymodi.com](https://anaymodi.com) and connect with me on [Twitter](https://x.com/AnayModi) & [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anay-modi/)!

**Some things I’ve done:**
- → Founded *Plack*, a consumer app to scan your favorite food products for microplastics. [plack.io](https://plack.io)
- → Tried shipping an [AI memories app](https://nostalgia-app.com) (which never made it to the app store ...).
- → Engaged in lots of ML research in healthcare, hackathon projects with AR/VR & LLMs, and independent projects involving distributed systems & AI acceleration.
- → Scaled a community of UofM engineers, hackers, and founders called [V1 Michigan](v1michigan.com) (hosted coworking sessions, dinners/meetups, and demo days).
